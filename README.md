# Mendelian-Randomization-on-couples
Dissecting mechanisms driving phenotypic similarities of couples by using mendelian randomization

Purpose of the study: characterise which human traits has the most causal effect on mate choice and see if there is differences between male-to-female and female-to-male causal effects.

Using 38 phenotypes and ~78,000 inferred couples from the UK BioBank
Causal effect estimates were done using the TwoSampleMR package. Estimation was done for female-to-male and male-to-female causal effects.
